# Critical Commands for Render Deployment

To ensure your email configuration works, you MUST run these commands in the Render Shell or via the Maintenance Route.

## Option 1: Render Shell (SSH)
1. Go to Render Dashboard > Shell
2. Run:
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan route:clear

## Option 2: Maintenance Route (Easier)
Run this URL in your browser:
https://solocart-backend.onrender.com/api/system/maintenance?key=render_fix_2026&optimize=1

This will clear all caches and ensure your .env changes (like Brevo credentials) are loaded.
